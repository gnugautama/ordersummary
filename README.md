## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Here is how I aligned the song icon, text and button horizontally.

  <!--to make the middle section-->
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2">
              <img src="/img/icon-music.svg" alt="" class="" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
              <h5 style="font-size: 13px">Annual Plan</h5>
              <p>$59.99/year</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4 pt-2" style="font-size: 13px">
              <a href="#" class="">Change</a>
            </div>
          </div>
   <!--end of middle section-->


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
